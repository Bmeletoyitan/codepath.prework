## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
    The only resource I used was youtube which was to search for clearer instructions and export settings         since I was having trouble exporting my files

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
    One of my biggest challenges during the creation of the project was getting acclamatized to the IDE.  
    Interestingly, JavaScript was closer to Java than I expected. It was a bit easier you use since I had         experience with a similar language. However, I found myself making some syntax errors that caused many       issues that might have been caught by the IDE used in school. I had to make sure that I went over every       line of code to make sure there were no syntax errors that I did not catch. The only other problem I had     was navigating CSS. I found I wasn't getting the changes to the environment as expected. It took a bit of     reconfiguring and going over the instructions multiple times to get the intended result.
    

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    One of the biggest questions is the process of turning an idea or inspiration into concrete work. I love to draw and web development(front-end languages) has intrigued me because it is one of the avenues of coding where your creativity can shine. How much freedom do you have in the implementation of an idea? What are the limitations? What resources can be used to mitigate some of the limitations present? How does web-development interact with other back-end programming languages? What tools are available for use to maximize time and creativity? These are some of the questions that come to mind when thinking about web development

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
This is a list of things I loved to implement with more time and knowledge
    1.) A tracker for the high score that the player has
    2.) Different levels of difficulty that increase the more the player wins the game. Number of buttons increase as well(finite amount)
    3.) With each different level, tunes of more complicated songs will be played(e.g Beethoven Symphony No. 5, No. 9)
    4.) A background that changes and complements the sequence of sounds played
    5.) a leaderboard of the highes player values in the user's area
